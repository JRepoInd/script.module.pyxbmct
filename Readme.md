PyXBMCt
=======

PyXBMCt is a mini-framework which simplifies UI creation for [Kodi (XBMC)](www.kodi.tv) addons.
It was inspired by PyQt GUI framework (hence the name) and provides a main window and a number of controls (widgets).
The main windows serves as a parent widget for the controls much like QtGui.QWidget class and provides a grid layout
manager to place the controls.

The framework uses image textures from Kodi Estuary and Confluence skins.

See also [PyXBMCt demo addon](https://github.com/romanvm/pyxbmct.demo) that demonstrates
the usage of PyXBMCt mini-framework.
